# Registry

This repository contains the setup for my Verdaccio npm registry; I use it to develop and test libraries before publishing them to the public npm registry.

# Usage

You can clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/F2BEAR/registry` and then run `npm run compose`; this will compose the docker image that I'm runing. 

**Notice that you need a docker engine runing to make this work.**
